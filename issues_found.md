#Functional issues found


* There is no "clear" function available
    * For each of my tests, I need to either reload a new browser instance OR,
     make sure the equation field is empty. 
     
     
* The website where the calculator isn't using a valid SSL certificate
    - don't know if its intended, but seeing that browsers are moving
    towards trying to limit access to non HTTPS web sites, this might
    need to be looked at.
